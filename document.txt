Tools Need:
1. MySql Installed on System
2. Node JS Installed on System

Steps:
1. Create Project Directory

2. Now, go to the project directory and run
=> npm init

3. Create Main JS file for e.g. index.js in root directory

4. Add this code to package.json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node index"
}

5. Install some of the dependencies that will help in constructing our API server easily
=> npm install express cors morgan sequelize cookie-parser mysql2
=> npm install sequelize-cli

6. Sequlize CLI Setup
=> npx sequelize-cli init
This will add these folders (config, models, migrations, seeders) in your project structure.

7. Change DB Credential in config/config.json for development
"development": {
    "username": "root", <--------
    "password": null, <--------
    "database": "database_development", <-------
    "host": "127.0.0.1", <---------
    "dialect": "mysql"
},

8. Create User models in your database
=> npx sequelize-cli model:generate --name User --attributes firstName:string,lastName:string,email:string
It adds the user.js file in models folder and adds a migration file in migrations folder.

9. Migrating these changes in your localhost database
=> npx sequelize-cli db:create    <====  (Create New Database)
=> npx sequelize-cli db:migrate   <====  (Migrate Models in Database)

10. Check your MySQL Database
You can see a new table has been created. That means we have successfully integrated Node JS, Sequelize and MySQL.
